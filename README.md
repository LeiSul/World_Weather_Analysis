# World_Weather_Analysis
### API Project Overview
In this project we take a look at improving a trip planning application to include the current weather conditions while also randomly selecting 
travel areas based on minimum and maximum temperatures. By allowing the selection of temperature, we open the options for the user to find multiple
locations for travel. In this selection option, we review the random generation from the Google Maps API. In using thisinformation we create travel routes 
while simultaneously generating travel markers reflecting Hotel names, City, Country, temp and current weather conditions based on current time.
